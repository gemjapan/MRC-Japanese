# Machine-readable-consent Japanese

The [Machine Readable Consent Guidance](https://www.ga4gh.org/wp-content/uploads/Machine-readable-Consent-Guidance_6JUL2020-1.pdf) provides instructions for researchers integrate standard data sharing language into consent forms in a way that is able to be translated to a computable language. Machine readable consent language is able to be attached to datasets and stored in their descriptive data using DUO terms. Researchers can then search for datasets that have been consented to for their research purposes. Machine Readable Consent Guidance was developed and approved by the [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)](https://www.ga4gh.org/).

To use the Machine Readable Consent Guidance in Japan, [GEM Japan DURI workstream group](https://github.com/gemjapan/DURI) translated it into Japanese.
